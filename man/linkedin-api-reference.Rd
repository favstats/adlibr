\title{LinkedIn Ad Library API Reference}
\description{
This file provides comprehensive documentation and reference information for
the LinkedIn Ad Library API, based on the official documentation.
}
\section{API Overview}{

LinkedIn's Ad Library application programming interface (API) helps you to
perform custom searches on ad data stored in the platform based on advertiser,
keywords, served dates and served countries.
}

\section{Authentication}{

The API uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. You must:
\enumerate{
\item Configure your LinkedIn app credentials using \code{li_auth_configure()}
\item Authenticate using \code{li_auth()} to obtain an access token
\item Use \code{li_query()} which automatically uses the cached token
}
}

\section{Query Parameters}{

The API accepts the following query parameters:
\describe{
\item{keyword}{String. Keyword that will be searched in the content of the ad.
If there are multiple keywords, separate them using a space. Multiple keywords
are treated as a logical AND operation.}
\item{countries}{Array of CountryUrns. CountryUrn is URN representation of
lowercase 2-letter ISO country codes.}
\item{advertiser}{String. Advertiser name that will be searched against the
advertiser of the ad.}
\item{dateRange}{DateRange. Date range to filter ads on the served dates.
Start represents the inclusive start time, End represents the exclusive end time.}
\item{start}{Integer. Used for pagination. Starting index of results.}
\item{count}{Integer. Used for pagination. Maximum 25 ads are returned and
count should be less than 25.}
}
}

\section{Response Schema}{

The API returns an \code{AdsCreativeTransparencyEntity} with the following structure:
\describe{
\item{adUrl}{URL pointing to ads preview URL}
\item{details}{AdTransparencyCreativeEntityDetails object containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{advertiser}: AdvertiserDetails (name, URL, payer)
\item \code{type}: Ad format type (e.g., "SPOTLIGHT_V2", "TEXT_AD")
\item \code{adTargeting}: Array of targeting parameters
\item \code{adStatistics}: Impression statistics and date ranges
}
}
\item{isRestricted}{Boolean indicating if ad violates LinkedIn's Advertising Policy}
\item{restrictionDetails}{String with restriction information (restricted ads only)}
}
}

\section{Example Usage}{

\preformatted{
# First-time setup
li_auth_configure()  # Enter your LinkedIn app credentials
li_auth()           # Authenticate via browser

# Search for ads by keyword and country
ads_by_keyword <- li_query(
  keyword = "data science",
  countries = c("us", "ca"),
  start_date = "2024-01-01",
  end_date = "2024-03-31"
)

# Search for ads by advertiser
ads_by_advertiser <- li_query(
  advertiser = "Google",
  countries = c("gb"),
  start_date = "2024-05-01",
  end_date = "2024-06-01",
  max_pages = 2
)
}
}

\section{Rate Limits and Best Practices}{

\itemize{
\item Maximum 25 results per request
\item Use pagination with \code{start} and \code{count} parameters
\item Date ranges: start is inclusive, end is exclusive
\item Country codes should be lowercase 2-letter ISO codes
\item Keywords are searched with logical AND operation
}
}
